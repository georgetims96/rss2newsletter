- Celery redownloads entries. Need to either have some duplicate detection or rely on timestamps
- Feedparser uses timestructs, which do not contain timezone information
- ~Pagination is not working for entries given the filter~
- Some posts do not have timestamps. This currently breaks the model's save override.
- Need to add entries in correct order when timestamp is not provided
- Need to add correct ordering for a ListView
- ~Bug where if you add subscription in new window you can also add it in the main window. Result is two subscriptions.~
- Bug with hitting 'back' for any view that incorporates RedirectView hack
