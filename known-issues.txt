- Celery redownloads entries. Need to either have some duplicate detection or rely on timestamps
- Feedparser uses timestructs, which do not contain timezone information
- ~Pagination is not working for entries given the filter~
- Some posts do not have timestamps. This currently breaks the model's save override.
